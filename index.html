            <p>We are a new type of lender that offers merit-based loans to financially responsible people. We use data-intensive modern technology to get a more complete understanding of each client's background, financial picture, and future potential during our lending process.</p>

            <span class="tophead">What can Earnest offer me?</span>
            <p>Because we recognize that your participation in General Assembly is an investment in your  career, we waive our normal requirement that you be employed. Additionally, we give you priority applicant status, so that your application is processed as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>For immersive courses, provided you set up autopay for your loan repayments, your loan is deferred until graduation. Interest begins to accumulate from the start of your program. Repayments begin only after you graduate.</p>
